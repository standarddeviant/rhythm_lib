# `rhythm_lib`
This library is intended to be used by musical synthesizer projects on
microcontrollers or elsewhere.

Intrigued by the concept of Euclidian Rhythms, I read this 
[https://medium.com/code-music-noise/euclidean-rhythms-391d879494df](article on Medium)
that led me to the book, [http://www.abrazol.com/books/rhythm1/](Creating Rhythms).

This library is basically converting the
[http://www.abrazol.com/books/rhythm1/software.html](Creating Rhythms, CLI Software)
to be callable functions and to be aware of `rhythm_t` data-type that makes use of the
[https://github.com/noporpoise/BitArray](BIT_ARRAY data-type).

This library is aimed at creating interesting rhythms from algorithms with
convenient data types. This library does not take care of any timing logic for
when to play sounds or trigger events.

This is a Work-In-Progress and aimed at facilitating fun, engaging music projects.
